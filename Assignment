The provided answer offers a detailed breakdown for implementing an authentication and authorization system with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Node.js. Hereâ€™s a streamlined and clarified version addressing the core points:


Comprehensive Answer: Authentication and Authorization System with RBAC

Overview
This system secures user access by implementing Authentication, Authorization, and RBAC using:
- Node.js and Express.js: For server-side logic.
- MongoDB: For storing user credentials, roles, and permissions.

Core Features

1. Authentication
   - User Registration: Allows users to sign up with a `username`, `email`, and a securely hashed `password` (using `bcrypt`).
   - User Login: Authenticates registered users via their credentials and issues JWT tokens.
   - User Logout: Invalidates tokens to ensure secure sessions.

2. Authorization
   - Assigns roles to users (e.g., `admin`, `editor`, `viewer`).
   - Uses middleware to validate permissions before granting access to specific routes or resources.

3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Stores roles and associated permissions in a MongoDB collection.
   - Middleware checks user roles/permissions dynamically to authorize access.


Implementation and Best Practices

1. Security
   - Password Hashing: Uses `bcrypt` for one-way password hashing.
   - Token Security: Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session management.
   - **CSRF Protection: Implemented via `csurf`.
   - HTTP Headers: Configured using `helmet` for added security.

2. RBAC Middleware
   - Middleware dynamically validates roles and permissions.
   - Example:
     javascript
     const checkRole = (role) => {
       return (req, res, next) => {
         if (req.user && req.user.role === role) {
           next();
         } else {
           res.status(403).send("Forbidden");
         }
       };
     };
     

3. Database Design
   - Users Collection:
     json
     {
       "username": "john",
       "email": "john@example.com",
       "password": "hashed_password",
       "role": "admin"
     }
     
   - Roles Collection:
     json
     {
       "role": "admin",
       "permissions": ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
     }
     

 API Endpoints

 Authentication
- `POST /register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /login`: Authenticate and issue a JWT token.
- `POST /logout`: Invalidate the JWT token.

Authorization
- `GET /protected`: Access restricted to authenticated users.
- `GET /admin`: Access restricted to users with `admin` role.

RBAC
- `GET /rbac`: Demonstrates role-based access control.


Example Workflow

1. User Registration
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{"username": "john", "email": "john@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
   

2. User Login
   bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login \
   -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
   -d '{"username": "john", "password": "password123"}'
   

3. Access Protected Route
   bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/protected \
   -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token'
   


Evaluation Criteria

1. Security Best Practices:
   - Use `bcrypt` for password hashing.
   - Protect against CSRF with `csurf`.
   - Use secure HTTP headers (`helmet`).

2. Code Quality:
   - Modular code organization.
   - Clear comments and documentation.

3. Creativity and Additional Features:
   - Include features like password reset and account deletion** for enhanced usability.
   - Provide an intuitive user interface.
